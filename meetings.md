# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 11.2.2021 14:20-14:40 **
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja **

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*
*The aim of the project, Image Annotator (IA) Web API, was briefly introduced and presented with wiki documentation of the project. We briefly discussed the content of the aimed IA Web API, the objectives of the PWP course, and the objectives of the documentation in the wiki. For the most part, text of wiki project documentation was acceptable, but it needed some refining, additions, and transfers to meet the aimed specifications.
We discussed the project description in 'Overview', and why the IA Web API will be useful in the future, and what type of use cases are planned for the API to be implemented within the course. Chapter 'Overview 'did not require any changes.
The chapter 'Main concepts and relations' were discussed in more detailed manner. Text in this chapter should only describe the REST portion of the exercise work. We had described the purposes and operations of the IA Web API, but the purpose of this chapter is to focus on describing what concrete concepts the IA REST API deals with. Concrete concepts include for example image and annotation. From this paragraph, verbs should be reduced, i.e. the description of what is done should be reduced, and more descriptions should be made of which concepts are used,  i.e. more nouns should be used in the wiki description. Concepts that REST include are for example image, various annotations and labels, user information, date, and location.
The chapter 'API uses' described well the potential use case of the IA REST API attached to a third-party client. However, the ideas of the planned own clients and their description must be added to this chapter. Text should describe how REST API can be used, and what kind of client design the group has planned to on this course - for example 'Hate Speech Anno API Client' for annotation of hate speech images memes, and 'My Photo Label API Client' for collecting and labeling private photographs.
Good examples were found on the chapter 'Related work', so text did not need any changes.
