# Getting started
It is recommended to use virtual environment for using and testing the code. It is recommended to use VSCode.  Usage of Python 3.7 or newer version is required. Use "pip install" to install virtual environment packages.

# Setting up virtual environment
First create a folder for this project on your computer, where you will install the virtual environment. 
Next start VSCode, and in VSCode "File > Open Folder" where you installed the virtual environment. Then open Python Terminal "Terminal > New Terminal". In the terminal give following command (either one) where. 
 
  python -m venv .venv
  python -m venv /path/to/the/virtualenv (e.g. Win10 "python -m D:\folder\venv")
 
You will see a dialog box "We noticed a new virtual environment has been created. Do you want to select it for the workspace folder?" and answer to that question "YES". 

Next VSCodes bottom bar, left side there is text like "Python 3.7.4.64-bit". Press that test and select environment that was just created. Select environment "Python 3.7 (venv) ./venv/Scripts/python.exe so that the the text is changed into "Python 3.7.4.64-bit ('.venv')" which ends with the "('.venv'). 

You also notice that in VSCode terminal the command line starts with "(venv)" text. Step into terminal command line and install necessary packages.
  pip install Flask
  pip install pysqlite3
  pip install flask_sqlalchemy
Note! When you later run the code, there may be need to install some other missing package.
